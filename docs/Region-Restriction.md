## Region-restricted videos?

`--ignore-errors` and `--download-archive archive.log` will silently skip such videos.

To download as much videos as possible, using a VPN, switch between the USA and Germany, those are the 2 countries that have access to the most content.

If you follow a specific country's content, also switch to that country (e.g. switch to France if you follow French content).
